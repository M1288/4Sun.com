    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in 1957, SunSector Industries began as a quiet initiative under the codename "Project Radiant Crown." What started as a project to amplify artificial sunlight for crop growth quickly morphed into something... bigger. And brighter. Sometimes too bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 1960s, the company introduced the first prototypes of solar cognition enhancers. While originally intended to help plants grow smarter (yes, smarter), the tech mysteriously affected human dreams. Oops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 70s brought the "Echo Bloom Panels." Not only did they supercharge fields with solar energy, they also accidentally triggered memory loops in local wildlife. Allegedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the 1980s, our vending machines were reading emotional outputs. Happy? You got a sweet snack. Sad? Here’s a crunchy one. Angry? You probably broke the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 90s saw expansion into the synthwave personality market. We made AIs that remembered your favorite childhood shows—even if you didn’t have any.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, SunSector Industries has taken bold steps into the fields of nostalgia manipulation, invisible infrastructure, and, of course, memory containment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our company is proud to uphold transparency by releasing 3% of our history to the public. This page is part of that generous disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our motto: <em>"To the Light, With Eyes Closed."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolutely, completely unaffiliated with any secret agencies, old world orders, or interdimensional councils. Wink.
